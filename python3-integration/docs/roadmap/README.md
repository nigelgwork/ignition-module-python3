# Future Roadmap and Enhancement Plans
## Python 3 Integration Module for Ignition

This directory contains comprehensive planning documents for future enhancements to the Python 3 Integration module.

## Current Status

**Version:** v2.3.3 (December 2024)
**Completion:** ~85% of core features

The module is **production-ready** with full Designer IDE, process pooling, REST API, and script management. The documents in this directory outline enhancements for enterprise-scale deployments.

## Roadmap Documents

### 1. [Comprehensive Test Suite](./COMPREHENSIVE_TEST_SUITE.md)
**Priority:** HIGH | **Effort:** 3 weeks | **Impact:** Production Readiness

Implementation guide for achieving 80%+ code coverage with:
- Unit tests for all Gateway and Designer components
- Integration tests for end-to-end workflows
- Performance benchmarks and baselines
- Security validation tests
- CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions

**Why Needed:**
- Ensure stability across Ignition versions
- Prevent regressions in new releases
- Enable confident refactoring
- Meet enterprise quality standards

**Key Deliverables:**
- JUnit/Mockito test framework
- 80%+ code coverage
- Automated test execution in CI/CD
- Performance baselines
- Security validation suite

### 3. [Python Sandboxing and Security](./PYTHON_SANDBOXING_AND_SECURITY.md)
**Priority:** MEDIUM-HIGH | **Effort:** 3 weeks | **Impact:** Security & Compliance

Balanced security approach for trusted admin users:
- Resource protection (memory, CPU, disk, processes)
- Execution isolation (namespaces, containers)
- User context tracking and audit trails
- Script access control
- Network and file system monitoring
- Input validation and rate limiting

**Why Needed:**
- Prevent accidental resource exhaustion
- Meet compliance requirements (SOC2, HIPAA)
- Enable accountability and forensics
- Protect against compromised accounts
- Audit trail for regulatory compliance

**Key Deliverables:**
- Resource limit enforcement
- User ID extraction and tracking
- Audit logging system
- Script access control
- Security configuration UI
- Execution history dashboard
